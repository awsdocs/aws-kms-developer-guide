# Creating keys<a name="create-keys"></a>

You can create AWS KMS keys in the AWS Management Console, or by using the [CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html) operation or an [AWS CloudFormation template](creating-resources-with-cloudformation.md)\. During this process, you pick the type of the KMS key, its regionality \(single\-Region or multi\-Region\), and the origin of the key material \(by default, AWS KMS creates the key material\)\. You cannot change these properties after the KMS key is created\. You also set the key policy for the KMS key, which you can change at any time\.

This topic explains how to create the basic KMS key, a [symmetric encryption KMS key](concepts.md#symmetric-cmks) for a single Region with key material from AWS KMS\. You can use this KMS key to protect your resources in an AWS service\. For detailed information about symmetric encryption KMS keys, see [SYMMETRIC\_DEFAULT key spec](asymmetric-key-specs.md#key-spec-symmetric-default)\. For help creating other types of keys, see [Special\-purpose keys](key-types.md)\.

If you are creating a KMS key to encrypt data you store or manage in an AWS service, create a symmetric encryption KMS key\. [AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration) use only symmetric encryption KMS keys to encrypt your data\. These services do not support encryption with asymmetric KMS keys\. For help deciding which type of KMS key to create, see [Choosing a KMS key type](key-types.md#symm-asymm-choose)\.

**Note**  
Symmetric KMS keys are now called *symmetric encryption* KMS keys\. AWS KMS supports two kinds of symmetric KMS keys, [symmetric encryption KMS keys](concepts.md#symmetric-cmks) \(the default type\) and [HMAC KMS keys](concepts.md#hmac-key-concept), which are also symmetric keys\. 

When you create a KMS key in the AWS KMS console, you are required to give it an alias \(friendly name\)\. The `CreateKey` operation does not create an alias for the new KMS key\. To create an alias for a new or existing KMS key, use the [CreateAlias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAlias.html) operation\. For detailed information about aliases in AWS KMS, see [Using aliases](kms-alias.md)\.

## Permissions for creating KMS keys<a name="create-key-permissions"></a>

To create a KMS key in the console or by using the APIs, you must have the following permission in an IAM policy\. Whenever possible, use [condition keys](policy-conditions.md) to limit the permissions\. For example, you can use the [kms:KeySpec](conditions-kms.md#conditions-kms-key-spec) condition key in an IAM policy to allow principals to create only symmetric encryption keys\.

For an example of an IAM policy for principals who create keys, see [Allow a user to create KMS keys](customer-managed-policies.md#iam-policy-example-create-key)\.

**Note**  
Be cautious when giving principals permission to manage tags and aliases\. Changing a tag or alias can allow or deny permission to the customer managed key\. For details, see [ABAC for AWS KMS](abac.md)\.
+ [kms:CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html) is required\. 
+ [kms:CreateAlias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAlias.html) is required to create a KMS key in the console where an alias is required for every new KMS key\.
+ [kms:TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) is required to add tags while creating the KMS key\.
+ [iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateServiceLinkedRole.html) is required to create multi\-Region primary keys\. For details, see [Controlling access to multi\-Region keys](multi-region-keys-auth.md)\.

The [kms:PutKeyPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_PutKeyPolicy.html) permission is not required to create the KMS key\. The `kms:CreateKey` permission includes permission to set the initial key policy\. But you must add this permission to the key policy while creating the KMS key to ensure that you can control access to the KMS key\. The alternative is using the [BypassLockoutSafetyCheck](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html#KMS-CreateKey-request-BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck) parameter, which is not recommended\.

KMS keys belong to the AWS account in which they were created\. The IAM user who creates a KMS key is not considered to be the key owner and they don't automatically have permission to use or manage the KMS key that they created\. Like any other principal, the key creator needs to get permission through a key policy, IAM policy, or grant\. However, principals who have the `kms:CreateKey` permission can set the initial key policy and give themselves permission to use or manage the key\.

## Creating symmetric encryption KMS keys<a name="create-symmetric-cmk"></a>

You can create KMS keys in the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS KMS API\. 

This topic explains how to create the basic KMS key, a [symmetric encryption KMS key](concepts.md#symmetric-cmks) for a single Region with key material from AWS KMS\. You can use this KMS key to protect your resources in an AWS service\. For help creating other types of keys, see [Special\-purpose keys](key-types.md)\.

### Creating symmetric encryption KMS keys \(console\)<a name="create-keys-console"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console to create AWS KMS keys \(KMS keys\)\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/kms](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms)\.

1. To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper\-right corner of the page\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Customer managed keys**\.

1. Choose **Create key**\.

1. To create a symmetric encryption KMS key, for **Key type** choose **Symmetric**\.

   For information about how to create an asymmetric KMS key in the AWS KMS console, see [Creating asymmetric KMS keys \(console\)](asymm-create-key.md#create-asymmetric-keys-console)\.

1. In **Key usage**, the **Encrypt and decrypt** option is selected for you\.

   For information about how to create KMS keys that generate and verify MAC codes, see [Creating HMAC KMS keys](hmac-create-key.md)\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

   For information about the **Advanced options**, see [Special\-purpose keys](key-types.md)\.

1. Type an alias for the KMS key\. The alias name cannot begin with **aws/**\. The **aws/** prefix is reserved by Amazon Web Services to represent AWS managed keys in your account\.
**Note**  
Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the KMS key\. For details, see [ABAC for AWS KMS](abac.md) and [Using aliases to control access to KMS keys](alias-authorization.md)\.

   An alias is a display name that you can use to identify the KMS key\. We recommend that you choose an alias that indicates the type of data you plan to protect or the application you plan to use with the KMS key\.

   Aliases are required when you create a KMS key in the AWS Management Console\. They are optional when you use the [CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html) operation\.

1. \(Optional\) Type a description for the KMS key\.

   You can add a description now or update it any time unless the [key state](key-state.md) is `Pending Deletion` or `Pending Replica Deletion`\. To add, change, or delete the description of an existing customer managed key, [edit the description](editing-keys.md) in the AWS Management Console or use the [UpdateKeyDescription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateKeyDescription.html) operation\.

1. \(Optional\) Type a tag key and an optional tag value\. To add more than one tag to the KMS key, choose **Add tag**\.
**Note**  
Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key\. For details, see [ABAC for AWS KMS](abac.md) and [Using tags to control access to KMS keys](tag-authorization.md)\.

   When you add tags to your AWS resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags\. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key\. For information about tagging KMS keys, see [Tagging keys](tagging-keys.md) and [ABAC for AWS KMS](abac.md)\. 

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. Select the IAM users and roles that can administer the KMS key\.
**Note**  
This key policy gives the AWS account full control of this KMS key\. It allows account administrators to use IAM policies to give other principals permission to manage the KMS key\. For details, see [Default key policy](key-policy-default.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) To prevent the selected IAM users and roles from deleting this KMS key, in the **Key deletion** section at the bottom of the page, clear the **Allow key administrators to delete this key** check box\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. Select the IAM users and roles that can use the key in [cryptographic operations](concepts.md#cryptographic-operations)
**Note**  
This key policy gives the AWS account full control of this KMS key\. It allows account administrators to use IAM policies to give other principals permission to use the KMS key in cryptographic operations\. For details, see [Default key policy](key-policy-default.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) You can allow other AWS accounts to use this KMS key for cryptographic operations\. To do so, in the **Other AWS accounts** section at the bottom of the page, choose **Add another AWS account** and enter the AWS account identification number of an external account\. To add multiple external accounts, repeat this step\.
**Note**  
To allow principals in the external accounts to use the KMS key, Administrators of the external account must create IAM policies that provide these permissions\. For more information, see [Allowing users in other accounts to use a KMS key](key-policy-modifying-external-accounts.md)\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. Review the key settings that you chose\. You can still go back and change all settings\.

1. Choose **Finish** to create the KMS key\.

### Creating symmetric encryption KMS keys \(AWS KMS API\)<a name="create-keys-api"></a>

You can use the [CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html) operation to create AWS KMS keys of all types\. These examples use the [AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), but you can use any supported programming language\. 

The following operation creates the most commonly used KMS key, a symmetric encryption key in a single Region backed by key material generated by AWS KMS\. This operation has no required parameters\. However, you might also want to use the `Policy` parameter to specify a key policy\. You can change the key policy \([PutKeyPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_PutKeyPolicy.html)\) and add optional elements, such as a [description](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html) and [tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) at any time\. You can also create [asymmetric keys](asymm-create-key.md#create-asymmetric-keys-api), [multi\-Region keys](multi-region-keys-create.md), keys with [imported key material](importing-keys-create-cmk.md#importing-keys-create-cmk-api), and keys in [custom key stores](create-cmk-keystore.md#create-cmk-keystore-api)\.

The `CreateKey` operation doesn't let you specify an alias, but you can use the [CreateAlias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAlias.html) operation to create an alias for your new KMS key\.

The following is an example of a call to the `CreateKey` operation with no parameters\. This command uses all of the default values\. It creates a symmetric encryption KMS key with key material generated by AWS KMS\.

```
$ aws kms create-key
{
    "KeyMetadata": {
        "Origin": "AWS_KMS",
        "KeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
        "Description": "",
        "KeyManager": "CUSTOMER",
        "Enabled": true,
        "KeySpec": "SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT",
        "CustomerMasterKeySpec": "SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT",
        "KeyUsage": "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT",
        "KeyState": "Enabled",
        "CreationDate": 1502910355.475,
        "Arn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
        "AWSAccountId": "111122223333",
        "MultiRegion": false
        "EncryptionAlgorithms": [
            "SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT"
        ],
    }
}
```

If you do not specify a key policy for your new KMS key, the [default key policy](key-policy-default.md) that `CreateKey` applies differs from the default key policy that the console applies when you use it to create a new KMS key\. 

For example, this call to the [GetKeyPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetKeyPolicy.html) operation returns the key policy that `CreateKey` applies\. It gives the AWS account access to the KMS key and allows it to create AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policies for the KMS key\. For detailed information about IAM policies and key policies for KMS keys, see [Authentication and access control for AWS KMS](control-access.md)

```
$ aws kms get-key-policy --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab --policy-name default --output text
{
  "Version" : "2012-10-17",
  "Id" : "key-default-1",
  "Statement" : [ {
    "Sid" : "Enable IAM policies",
    "Effect" : "Allow",
    "Principal" : {
      "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
    },
    "Action" : "kms:*",
    "Resource" : "*"
  } ]
}
```
