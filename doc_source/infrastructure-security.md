# Infrastructure security in AWS Key Management Service<a name="infrastructure-security"></a>

As a managed service, AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the [Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf)\.

To access AWS KMS over the network, you can call the AWS KMS API operations that are described in the [AWS Key Management Service API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/)\. AWS KMS supports Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) 1\.0—1\.3 in all regions, except AWS GovCloud \(US\) and China Regions\. The AWS GovCloud \(US\) region only supports TLS 1\.0—1\.2 for AWS KMS service endpoints\. AWS KMS does not support hybrid post\-quantum TLS for endpoints in AWS GovCloud \(US\)\. To use the [standard AWS KMS endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html), clients must support TLS 1\.0 or later\. To use the [AWS KMS FIPS endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html), clients must support TLS 1\.2 or later\. AWS KMS recommends you always use the latest supported TLS version\. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\) such as Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(DHE\) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(ECDHE\)\. Most modern systems, such as Java 7 and later, support these modes\.

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.

You can call these API operations from any network location, but AWS KMS supports global policy conditions that let you control access to a KMS key based on the source IP address, VPC, and VPC endpoint\. You can use these condition keys in key policies and IAM policies\. However, these conditions can prevent AWS from using the KMS key on your behalf\. For details, see [AWS global condition keys](conditions-aws.md)\.

For example, the following key policy statement allows users who can assume the `KMSTestRole` role to use this AWS KMS key for the specified [cryptographic operations](concepts.md#cryptographic-operations) unless the source IP address is one of the IP addresses specified in the policy\.

```

  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {"AWS":

      "kms:DescribeKey"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
      "NotIpAddress": {
        "aws:SourceIp": [
          "192.0.2.0/24",
          "203.0.113.0/24"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Isolation of Physical Hosts<a name="compliance-physical-security"></a>

The security of the physical infrastructure that AWS KMS uses is subject to the controls described in the **Physical and Environmental Security** section of the [Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf)\. You can find more detail in compliance reports and third\-party audit findings listed in the previous section\.

AWS KMS is supported by dedicated hardened hardware security modules \(HSMs\) designed with specific controls to resist physical attacks\. The HSMs are physical devices that *do not* have a virtualization layer, such as a hypervisor, that shares the physical device among several logical tenants\. The key material for AWS KMS keys is stored only in volatile memory on the HSMs, and only while the KMS key is in use\. This memory is erased when the HSM moves out of the operational state, including intended and unintended shutdowns and resets\. For detailed information about the operation of AWS KMS HSMs, see [AWS Key Management Service Cryptographic Details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/cryptographic-details/)\.
