# Monitoring an external key store<a name="xks-monitoring"></a>

AWS KMS collects metrics for each interaction with an external key store and publishes them in your CloudWatch account\. These metrics are used to generate the graphs in the monitoring section of the detail page for each external key store\. The following topic details how to use the graphs to identify and troubleshoot operational and configuration issues impacting your external key store\. We recommend using the CloudWatch metrics to set alarms that notify you when your external key store isn't performing as expected\. For more information, see [Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch](monitoring-cloudwatch.md)\.

## Viewing the graphs<a name="xks-monitoring-navigate"></a>

You can view the graphs at different levels of detail\. By default, each graph uses a three hour time range and five minute aggregation [period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#CloudWatchPeriods)\. You can adjust the graph view within the console, but your changes will revert to the default settings when the external key store detail page is closed or the browser is refreshed\. For help with Amazon CloudWatch terminology, see [Amazon CloudWatch concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html)\.

### View data point details<a name="graph-data-point"></a>

The data in each graph is collected by [AWS KMS metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html#kms-metrics)\. To view more information about a specific data point, pause the mouse over the data point on the line graph\. This will display a pop\-up with more information about the metric that the graph was derived from\. Each list item displays the [dimension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Dimension) value recorded at that data point\. The pop\-up displays a null value \(**â€“**\) if there is no metric data available for the dimension value at that data point\. Some graphs record multiple dimensions and values for a single data point\. Other graphs, like the [reliability graph](#reliability-graph), use the data collected by the metric to calculate a unique value\. Each list item is associated with a different line graph color\.

### Modify the time range<a name="graph-time-range"></a>

To modify the [time range](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/modify_graph_date_time.html), select one of the predefined time ranges in the upper right corner of the monitoring section\. The predefined time ranges span from 1 hour to 1 week \(**1h**, **3h**, **12h**, **1d**, **3d**, or **1w**\)\. This adjusts the time range for all graphs\. If you want to view one specific graph in a different time range, or if you want to set a custom time range, enlarge the graph or view it in the Amazon CloudWatch console\.

### Zoom in on graphs<a name="graph-zoom"></a>

You can use the [mini\-map zoom feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/zoom-graph.html) to focus on sections of line graphs and stacked portions of the graphs without changing between zoomed\-in and zoomed\-out views\. For example, you can use the mini\-map zoom feature to focus on a peak in a graph, so that you can compare the spike against other graphs in the monitoring section from the same timeline\. 

1. Choose and drag on the area of the graph that you want to focus on, and then release the drag\.

1. To reset the zoom, choose the **Reset zoom** icon, which looks like a magnifying glass with a minus \(\-\) symbol inside\.

### Enlarge a graph<a name="graph-enlarge"></a>

To enlarge a graph, select the menu icon in the upper right corner of an individual graph and choose **Enlarge**\. You can also select the enlarge icon that appears next to the menu icon when you hover over a graph\.

Enlarging a graph enables you to further modify the view of a graph by specifying a different period, custom time range, or refresh interval\. These changes will revert to the default settings when you close the enlarged view\.

Modify the period  

1. Choose the **Period options** menu\. By default, this menu displays the value: **5 minutes**\.

1. Choose a period, the predefined periods span from 1 second to 30 days\.

   For example, you can choose a one\-minute view, which can be useful when troubleshooting\. Or, choose a less detailed, one\-hour view\. That can be useful when viewing a broader time range \(for example, 3 days\) so that you can see trends over time\. For more information, see [Periods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#CloudWatchPeriods) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

Modify the time range or time zone  

1. Select one of the predefined time ranges, which span from 1 hour to 1 week \(**1h**, **3h**, **12h**, **1d**, **3d**, or **1w**\)\. Alternatively, you can choose **Custom** to set your own time range\.

1. Choose **Custom**

   1. *Time range:* select the **Absolute** tab in the upper left corner of the box\. Use the calendar picker or text field boxes to specify a time range\.

   1. *Time zone:* choose the dropdown in the upper right corner of the box\. You can change the time zone to **UTC** or **Local time zone**\.

1. After you specify a time range, choose **Apply**\.

Modify how often the data in your graph is refreshed  

1. Choose the **Refresh options** menu in the upper\-right corner\.

1. Choose a refresh interval \(**Off**, **10 Seconds**, **1 Minute**, **2 Minutes**, **5 Minutes**, or **15 Minutes**\)\. 

### View graphs in the Amazon CloudWatch console<a name="graph-in-cloudwatch"></a>

The graphs in the monitoring section are derived from predefined metrics that AWS KMS publishes to Amazon CloudWatch\. You can open them within the CloudWatch console and save them to CloudWatch dashboards\. If you have multiple external key stores, you can open their respective graphs in CloudWatch and save them to a single dashboard to compare their health and usage\.

**Add to CloudWatch dashboard**  
Select **Add to dashboard** in the upper right corner to add all of the graphs to an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard\. You can either select an existing dashboard or create a new one\. For information on using this dashboard to create customized views of the graphs and alarms, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Dashboards.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

**View in CloudWatch metrics**  
Select the menu icon in the upper right corner of an individual graph and choose **View in metrics** to view this graph in the Amazon CloudWatch console\. From the CloudWatch console, you can add this single graph to a dashboard and modify time ranges, periods, and refresh intervals\. For more information see, [Graphing metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph_metrics.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

## Interpreting the graphs<a name="interpreting-graphs"></a>

AWS KMS provides several graphs to monitor the health of your external key store within the AWS KMS console\. These graphs are automatically configured and derived from [AWS KMS metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html#kms-metrics)\.

The graph data is collected as part of the calls you make to your external key store and external keys\. You might see data populating graphs during a time range that you did not make any calls, this data comes from the periodic `GetHealthStatus` calls that AWS KMS makes on your behalf to check the status of your external key store proxy and external key manager\. If your graphs display the message **No data available**, then there were no calls recorded during that time range or your external key store is in a [`DISCONNECTED`](xks-connect-disconnect.md#xks-connection-state) state\. You might be able to identify the time your external key store disconnected by [adjusting your view](#graph-time-range) to a broader time range\.

### Total requests<a name="total-requests-graph"></a>

The total number of AWS KMS requests being received for a specific external key store during a given time range\. Use this graph to determine if you are at risk of throttling\.

AWS KMS recommends that your external key manager be able to handle up to 1800 requests for cryptographic operations per second\. If you approach 540,000 calls in a five\-minute period, you are at risk of throttling\.

If you are getting very frequent `KMSInvalidStateException` errors with a message that explains that the request was rejected "due to a very high request rate," it might indicate that your external key manager or external key store proxy cannot keep pace with the current request rate\. In that case, consider [requesting a decrease](increase-quota.md) in your custom key store request quota value\. Decreasing this quota value might increase throttling, but it indicates that AWS KMS is rejecting excess requests quickly before they are sent to your external key store proxy or external key manager\. You can monitor the number of requests for cryptographic operations on KMS keys in your external key store that AWS KMS throttles with the [ExternalKeyStoreThrottle](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-throttling) metric\.

The total requests graph is derived from the [XksProxyErrors](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-errors) metric, which collects data on both the successful and unsuccessful responses that AWS KMS receives from your external key store proxy\. When you [view a specific data point](#graph-data-point), the pop\-up displays the value of the `CustomKeyStoreId` dimension alongside the total number of AWS KMS requests recorded at that data point\. The `CustomKeyStoreId` will always be the same\.

### Reliability<a name="reliability-graph"></a>

The percentage of AWS KMS requests for which the external key store proxy returned either a successful response or a non\-retryable error\. Use this graph to evaluate the operational health of your external key store proxy\.

When the graph displays a value less than 100%, it indicates cases where the proxy either did not respond or responded with a retryable error\. This can indicate problems with the network, slowness of the external key store proxy or external key manager, or implementation bugs\.

If the request includes a bad credential and your proxy responds with an `AuthenticationFailedException`, the graph will still indicate 100% reliability because the proxy identified an incorrect value in the [external key store proxy API request](keystore-external.md#concept-proxy-apis), and therefore the failure is expected\. If the percentage of your reliability graph is 100%, then your external key store proxy is responding as expected\. If the graph displays a value less than 100%, then the proxy either responded with a retryable error or timed out\. For example, if the proxy responds with a `ThrottlingException` due to a very high request rate, it will display a lower reliability percentage because the proxy was unable to identify a specific problem in the request that caused it to fail\. This is because retryable errors are likely transient problems that can be resolved by retrying the request\.

The following error responses will lower the reliability percentage\. You can use the [Top 5 exceptions](#top-5-exceptions-graph) graph and the [XksProxyErrors](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-errors) metric to further monitor how frequently your proxy returns each retryable error\.
+ `InternalException`
+ `DependencyTimeoutException`
+ `ThrottlingException`
+ `XksProxyUnreachableException`

The reliability graph is derived from the [XksProxyErrors](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-errors) metric, which collects data on both the successful and unsuccessful responses that AWS KMS receives from your external key store proxy\. The reliability percentage will only lower if the response has an `ErrorType` value of `Retryable`\. When you [view a specific data point](#graph-data-point), the pop\-up displays the value of the `CustomKeyStoreId` dimension alongside the reliability percentage for AWS KMS requests recorded at that data point\. The `CustomKeyStoreId` will always be the same\.

We recommend using the [XksProxyErrors](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-errors) metric to create a CloudWatch alarm that notifies you of potential networking problems by alerting you when more than five retryable errors are recorded in a one minute period\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for retryable errors](#retryable-errors-alarm)\.

### Latency<a name="latency-graph"></a>

The number of milliseconds it takes for an external key store proxy to respond to an AWS KMS request\. Use this graph to evaluate the performance of your external key store proxy and external key manager\.

AWS KMS expects the external key store proxy to respond to each request within 250 milliseconds\. In the case of network timeouts, AWS KMS will retry the request once\. If the proxy fails a second time, the recorded latency is the combined timeout limit for both request attempts and the graph will display approximately 500 milliseconds\. In all other cases where the proxy doesn't respond within the 250 millisecond timeout limit, the recorded latency is 250 milliseconds\. If the proxy is frequently timing out on encryption and decryption operations, consult your external proxy administrator\. For help troubleshooting latency problems, see [Latency and timeout errors](xks-troubleshooting.md#fix-xks-latency)\.

Slow responses might also indicate that your external key manager cannot handle the current request traffic\. AWS KMS recommends that your external key manager be able to handle up to 1800 requests for cryptographic operations per second\. If your external key manager cannot handle the 1800 requests per second rate, consider requesting a decrease in your [request quota for KMS keys in a custom key store](requests-per-second.md#rps-key-stores)\. Requests for cryptographic operations using the KMS keys in your external key store will fail fast with a [throttling exception](throttling.md), rather than being processed and later rejected by your external key store proxy or external key manager\.

The latency graph is derived from the [XksProxyLatency](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-latency) metric\. When you [view a specific data point](#graph-data-point), the pop\-up displays the corresponding `KmsOperation` and `XksOperation` dimension values alongside the average latency recorded for the operations at that data point\. The list items are ordered from highest latency to lowest\.

We recommend using the [XksProxyLatency](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-latency) metric to create a CloudWatch alarm that notifies you when your latency is approaching the timeout limit\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for response timeout](#latency-alarm)\.

### Top 5 exceptions<a name="top-5-exceptions-graph"></a>

The top five exceptions for failed cryptographic and management operations during a given time range\. Use this graph to track the most frequent errors, so you can prioritize your engineering effort\.

This count includes exceptions that AWS KMS received from the external key store proxy and the `XksProxyUnreachableException` that AWS KMS returns internally when it cannot establish communication with the external key store proxy\.

High rates of retryable errors might indicate networking errors, while high rates of non\-retryable errors might indicate a problem with the configuration of your external key store\. For example, a spike in `AuthenticationFailedExceptions` indicates a discrepancy between the authentication credentials configured in AWS KMS and the external key store proxy\. To view your external key store configuration, see [Viewing an external key store](view-xks-keystore.md)\. To edit your external key store settings, see [Editing external key store properties](update-xks-keystore.md)\.

The exceptions that AWS KMS receives from the external key store proxy are different from the exceptions that AWS KMS returns to you when an operation fails\. For errors on cryptographic operations with KMS keys in custom key stores, AWS KMS always returns `KMSInvalidStateException`\. To identify the problem, use the accompanying error message text\.

The following table shows the exceptions that can appear in the top 5 exceptions graph and the corresponding exceptions that AWS KMS returns to you\.


| Error type | Exception displayed in the graph | Exception that AWS KMS returned to you | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Non\-retryable | AccessDeniedException   For troubleshooting help, see [Proxy authorization issues](xks-troubleshooting.md#fix-xks-authorization)\. | **`CustomKeyStoreInvalidStateException`** in response to `CreateKey` operations\. **`KMSInvalidStateException`** in response to cryptographic operations\. |

| Retryable | **`XksProxyUnreachableException`** If you see this error repeatedly, verify that your external key store proxy is active and is connected to the network, and that its URI path and endpoint URI or VPC service name are correct in your external key store\. | **`XksProxyUriUnreachableException`** in response to `CreateCustomKeyStore` and `UpdateCustomKeyStore` operations\. **`CustomKeyStoreInvalidStateException`** in response to `CreateKey` operations\. **`KMSInvalidStateException`** in response to cryptographic operations\. | 

The top 5 exceptions graph is derived from the [XksProxyErrors](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-errors) metric\. When you [view a specific data point](#graph-data-point), the pop\-up displays the value of the `ExceptionName` dimension alongside the number of times that the exception was recorded at that data point\. The five list items are ordered from most frequent exception to least\.

We recommend using the [XksProxyErrors](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-errors) metric to create a CloudWatch alarm that notifies you of potential configuration problems by alerting you when more than five non\-retryable errors are recorded in a one minute period\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for non\-retryable errors](#nonretryable-errors-alarm)\.

### Certificate days to expire<a name="cert-expire-graph"></a>

The number of days until the TLS certificate for your external key store proxy endpoint \(`XksProxyUriEndpoint`\) expires\. Use this graph to monitor upcoming expiration of your TLS certificate\.

**Note**  
Certificate days to expire currently does not display a value if your TLS certificate subject CN includes a wildcard character\.

When the certificate expires, AWS KMS cannot communicate with the external key store proxy\. All data protected by KMS keys in your external key store becomes inaccessible until you renew the certificate\. 

The certificate days to expire graph is derived from the [XksProxyCertificateDaysToExpire](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-certificate-days-to-expire) metric\. We strongly recommend using this metric to create a CloudWatch alarm that notifies you about the upcoming expiration\. Certificate expiration might prevent you from accessing your encrypted resources\. Set the alarm to give your organization time to renew the certificate before it expires\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for certificate expiration](#cert-expire-alarm)\.

## Setting alarms<a name="xks-alarms"></a>

The graphs in the monitoring section provide an overview of the health of your external key stores and KMS keys in external key stores for a given period of time\. However, you can create Amazon CloudWatch alarms based on external key store metrics to notify you when a metric value exceeds a threshold you specified\. The alarm can send the message to an [Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.html) or an [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scale-based-on-demand.html#as-how-scaling-policies-work)\. For detailed information about CloudWatch alarms, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

Before creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm, you need an Amazon SNS topic\. For details, see [Creating an Amazon SNS topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

### Creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for certificate expiration<a name="cert-expire-alarm"></a>

This alarm uses the [XksProxyCertificateDaysToExpire](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-certificate-days-to-expire) metric that AWS KMS publishes to CloudWatch to record the anticipated expiration of the TLS certificate associated with your external key store proxy endpoint\. You cannot create a single alarm for all external key stores in your account or an alarm for external key stores that you might create in the future\.

We recommend setting the alarm to alert you 10 days before your certificate is set to expire, but you should set the threshold that best fits your needs\.

**Create the alarm**

Follow the instructions in [Create a CloudWatch alarm based on a static threshold](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ConsoleAlarms.html) using the following required values\. For other fields, accept the default values and provide names as requested\.

### Creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for response timeout<a name="latency-alarm"></a>

This alarm uses the [XksProxyLatency](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-latency) metric that AWS KMS publishes to CloudWatch to record the number of milliseconds it takes for an external key store proxy to respond to an AWS KMS request\. You cannot create a single alarm for all external key stores in your account or an alarm for external key stores that you might create in the future\.

AWS KMS expects the external key store proxy to respond to each request within 250 milliseconds\. We recommend setting an alarm to alert you when your external key store proxy takes longer than 200 milliseconds to respond, but you should set the threshold that best fits your needs\.

**Create the alarm**

### Creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for retryable errors<a name="retryable-errors-alarm"></a>

This alarm uses the [XksProxyErrors](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-errors) metric that AWS KMS publishes to CloudWatch to record the number of exceptions related to AWS KMS requests to your external key store proxy\. You cannot create a single alarm for all external key stores in your account or an alarm for external key stores that you might create in the future\.

Retryable errors will lower your reliability percentage and can indicate networking errors\. We recommend setting an alarm to alert you when more than five retryable errors are recorded in a one minute period, but you should set the threshold that best fits your needs\.

Follow the instructions in [Create a CloudWatch alarm based on a static threshold](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ConsoleAlarms.html) using the following required values\. For other fields, accept the default values and provide names as requested\.

### Creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for non\-retryable errors<a name="nonretryable-errors-alarm"></a>

This alarm uses the [XksProxyErrors](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#metric-xks-proxy-errors) metric that AWS KMS publishes to CloudWatch to record the number of exceptions related to AWS KMS requests to your external key store proxy\. You cannot create a single alarm for all external key stores in your account or an alarm for external key stores that you might create in the future\.

Non\-retryable errors can indicate a problem with the configuration of your external key store\. We recommend setting an alarm to alert you when more than five non\-retryable errors are recorded in a one minute period, but you should set the threshold that best fits your needs\.
