# Finding KMS keys and key material<a name="find-key-material"></a>

If you manage an AWS CloudHSM key store, you might need to identify the KMS keys in each AWS CloudHSM key store\. For example, you might need to do some of the following tasks\.
+ Track the KMS keys in AWS CloudHSM key store in AWS CloudTrail logs\. 
+ Predict the effect on KMS keys of disconnecting an AWS CloudHSM key store\. 
+ Schedule deletion of KMS keys before you delete an AWS CloudHSM key store\. 

In addition, you might want to identify the keys in your AWS CloudHSM cluster that serve as key material for your KMS keys\. Although AWS KMS manages the KMS keys and the key material, you still retain control of and responsibility for the management of your AWS CloudHSM cluster, as well as the HSMs and backups and the keys in the HSMs\. You might need to identify the keys in order to audit the key material, protect it from accidental deletion, or delete it from HSMs and cluster backups after deleting the KMS key\.

All key material for the KMS keys in your AWS CloudHSM key store is owned by the [`kmsuser` crypto user](hsm-key-store-concepts.md#concept-kmsuser) \(CU\)\. AWS KMS sets the key label attribute, which is viewable only in AWS CloudHSM, to the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the KMS key\.

To find KMS keys and key material, use any of the following techniques\.
+ [Find the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store](#find-cmk-in-keystore) — How to identify the KMS keys in one or all of your AWS CloudHSM key stores\.
+ [Find all keys for an AWS CloudHSM key store](#find-all-kmsuser-keys) — How to find all keys in your cluster that serve as key material for the KMS keys in your AWS CloudHSM key store\.
+ [Find the AWS CloudHSM key for a KMS key](#find-handle-for-cmk-id) — How to find the key in your cluster that serves as key material for a particular KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM key store\.
+ [Find the KMS key for an AWS CloudHSM key](#find-label-for-key-handle) — How to find the KMS key for a particular key in your cluster\. 

## Find the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store<a name="find-cmk-in-keystore"></a>

If you manage an AWS CloudHSM key store, you might need to identify the KMS keys in each AWS CloudHSM key store\. You can use this information track the KMS key operations in AWS CloudTrail logs, predict the effect on KMS keys of disconnecting a custom key store, or schedule deletion of KMS keys before you delete an AWS CloudHSM key store\. 

### To find the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store \(console\)<a name="find-cmk-in-keystore-console"></a>

To find the KMS keys in a particular AWS CloudHSM key store, on the **Customer managed keys** page, view the values in the **Custom Key Store Name** or **Custom Key Store ID** fields\. To identify KMS keys in any AWS CloudHSM key store, look for KMS keys with an **Origin** value of **AWS CloudHSM**\. To add optional columns to the display, choose the gear icon in the upper right corner of the page\.

### To find the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store \(API\)<a name="find-cmk-in-keystore-api"></a>

To find the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store, use the [ListKeys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ListKeys.html) and [DescribeKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html) operations and then filter by `CustomKeyStoreId` value\. Before running the examples, replace the fictitious custom key store ID values with a valid value\.

------
#### [ Bash ]

To find KMS keys in a particular AWS CloudHSM key store, get all of your KMS keys in the account and Region\. Then filter by the custom key store ID\. 

```
for key in $(aws kms list-keys --query 'Keys[*].KeyId' --output text) ; 
do aws kms describe-key --key-id $key | 
grep '"CustomKeyStoreId": "cks-1234567890abcdef0"' --context 100; done
```

To get KMS keys in any AWS CloudHSM key store in the account and Region, search for `CustomKeyStoreType` with a value of `AWS_CloudHSM`\.

```
for key in $(aws kms list-keys --query 'Keys[*].KeyId' --output text) ; 
do aws kms describe-key --key-id $key | 
grep '"CustomKeyStoreType": "AWS_CloudHSM"' --context 100; done
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

To find KMS keys in a particular AWS CloudHSM key store, use the [Get\-KmsKeyList](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-KMSKeyList.html) and [Get\-KmsKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-KMSKey.html) cmdlets to get all of your KMS keys in the account and Region\. Then filter by the custom key store ID\. 

```
PS C:\> Get-KMSKeyList | Get-KMSKey | where CustomKeyStoreId -eq 'cks-1234567890abcdef0'
```

To get KMS keys in any AWS CloudHSM key store in the account and Region, filter for the CustomKeyStoreType value of `AWS_CLOUDHSM`\.

```
PS C:\> Get-KMSKeyList | Get-KMSKey | where CustomKeyStoreType -eq 'AWS_CLOUDHSM'
```

## Find all keys for an AWS CloudHSM key store<a name="find-all-kmsuser-keys"></a>

You can identify the keys in your AWS CloudHSM cluster that serve as key material for your AWS CloudHSM key store\. To do that, use the [findAllKeys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/cloudhsm_mgmt_util-findAllKeys.html) command in cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util to find the key handles of all keys that `kmsuser` owns or shares\. Unless you have logged in as `kmsuser` and created keys outside of AWS KMS, all of the keys that `kmsuser` owns represent key material for KMS keys\. 

Any crypto officer in the cluster can run this command without disconnecting the AWS CloudHSM key store\.

1. Start cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util by using the procedure described in the [Getting started with CloudHSM Management Utility \(CMU\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/cloudhsm_mgmt_util-getting-started.html#cloudhsm_mgmt_util-setup) topic\.

1. Log into cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util using a crypto officer \(CO\) account\.

1. Use the [listUsers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/cloudhsm_mgmt_util-listUsers.html) command to find the user ID of the `kmsuser` crypto user\.

   In this example, `kmsuser` has user ID 3\.

   ```
   aws-cloudhsm> listUsers
   Users on server 0(10.0.0.1):
   Number of users found:3
   
       User Id             User Type       User Name            MofnPubKey    LoginFailureCnt         2FA
            1              PCO             admin                      NO               0               NO
            2              AU              app_user                   NO               0               NO
            3              CU              kmsuser                    NO               0               NO
   ```

1. Use the [findAllKeys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/cloudhsm_mgmt_util-findAllKeys.html) command to find the key handles of all keys that `kmsuser` owns or shares\. Replace the example user ID \(3\) with the actual user ID of `kmsuser` in your cluster\.

   The example output shows that `kmsuser` owns keys with key handles 8, 9, and 262162 on both HSMs in the cluster\.

   ```
   aws-cloudhsm> findAllKeys 3 0
   Keys on server 0(10.0.0.1):
   Number of keys found 3
   number of keys matched from start index 0::6
   8,9,262162
   findAllKeys success on server 0(10.0.0.1)
   
   Keys on server 1(10.0.0.2):
   Number of keys found 6
   number of keys matched from start index 0::6
   8,9,262162
   findAllKeys success on server 1(10.0.0.2)
   ```

## Find the KMS key for an AWS CloudHSM key<a name="find-label-for-key-handle"></a>

If you know the key handle of a key that `kmsuser` owns in the cluster, you can use the key label to identify the associated KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM key store\.

When AWS KMS creates the key material for a KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM cluster, it writes the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the KMS key in the key label\. Unless you have changed the label value, you can use the [getAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/cloudhsm_mgmt_util-getAttribute.html) command in key\_mgmt\_util or cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util to associate the key with its KMS key\. 

To run this procedure, you need to disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store temporarily so you can log in as the `kmsuser` CU\.

**Note**  
While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create KMS keys in the custom key store or to use existing KMS keys in cryptographic operations will fail\. This action can prevent users from storing and accessing sensitive data\.

1. Disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store, if not already disconnected\., then log into the key\_mgmt\_util as `kmsuser`, as explained in [How to disconnect and log in](fix-keystore.md#login-kmsuser-1)\.

1. Use the `getAttribute` command in [key\_mgmt\_util](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/key_mgmt_util-getAttribute.html) or [cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/cloudhsm_mgmt_util-getAttribute.html) to get the label attribute \(`OBJ_ATTR_LABEL`, attribute `3`\) for a particular key handle\. 

   For example, this command uses `getAttribute` in cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util to get the label attribute \(attribute `3`\) of the key with key handle `262162`\. The output shows that key `262162` serves as key material for the KMS key with ARN `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`\. Before running this command, replace the example key handle with a valid one\. 

   For a list of key attributes, use the [listAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/cloudhsm_mgmt_util-listAttributes.html) command or see the [Key Attribute Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/key-attribute-table.html) in the *AWS CloudHSM User Guide*\.

   ```
   aws-cloudhsm> getAttribute 262162 3
   
   Attribute Value on server 0(10.0.1.10):
   OBJ_ATTR_LABEL
   arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
   ```

1. Log out of key\_mgmt\_util or cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util and reconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store as explained in [How to log out and reconnect](fix-keystore.md#login-kmsuser-2)\.

## Find the AWS CloudHSM key for a KMS key<a name="find-handle-for-cmk-id"></a>

You can use the KMS key ID of a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store to identify the key in your AWS CloudHSM cluster that serves as its key material\. Then you can use its key handle to identify the key in AWS CloudHSM client commands\. 

When AWS KMS creates the key material for a KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM cluster, it writes the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the KMS key in the key label\. Unless you have changed the label value, you can use the [findKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/key_mgmt_util-findKey.html) command in key\_mgmt\_util to get the key handle of the key material for the KMS key\. To run this procedure, you need to disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store temporarily so you can log in as the `kmsuser` CU\. 

**Note**  
While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create KMS keys in the custom key store or to use existing KMS keys in cryptographic operations will fail\. This action can prevent users from storing and accessing sensitive data\.

1. Disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store, if it is not already disconnected, then log into the key\_mgmt\_util as `kmsuser`, as explained in [How to disconnect and log in](fix-keystore.md#login-kmsuser-1)\.

1. Use the [findKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/key_mgmt_util-findKey.html) command in key\_mgmt\_util to search for a key with a label that matches the ARN of a KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM key store\. Replace the example KMS key ARN in the value of the `-l` \(lower\-case L for 'label'\) parameter with a valid KMS key ARN\. 

   For example, this command finds the key with a label that matches the example KMS key ARN, `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`\. The example output shows that the key with key handle `262162` has the specified KMS key ARN in its label\. You can now use this key handle in other key\_mgmt\_util commands\.

   ```
   Command: findKey -l arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
   Total number of keys present 1
   
    number of keys matched from start index 0::1

           Cluster Error Status
           Node id 1 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
           Node id 0 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
   
           Cfm3FindKey returned: 0x00 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
   ```

1. Log out of key\_mgmt\_util and reconnect the custom key store as explained in [How to log out and reconnect](fix-keystore.md#login-kmsuser-2)\.
