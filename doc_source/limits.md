# Quotas<a name="limits"></a>

To make AWS KMS responsive and performant for all users, AWS KMS applies two types of quotas, resource quotas and request quotas\. Each quota is calculated independently for each Region of each AWS account\.

All AWS KMS quotas are adjustable, except for the [key policy document size resource quota](resource-limits.md#key-policy-limit) and the [custom key stores resource quota](resource-limits.md#cks-resource-quota)\. To request a quota increase, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\. To request a quota decrease, to change a quota that is not listed in Service Quotas, or to change a quota in an AWS Region where Service Quotas for AWS KMS is not available, please visit [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) and create a case\.
