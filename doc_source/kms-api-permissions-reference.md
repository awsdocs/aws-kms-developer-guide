# AWS KMS permissions<a name="kms-api-permissions-reference"></a>

This table is designed to help you understand AWS KMS permissions so you can control access to your AWS KMS resources\. Definitions of the column headings appear below the table\.

You can also learn about AWS KMS permissions in the [Actions, resources, and condition keys for AWS Key Management Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awskeymanagementservice.html) topic of the *Service Authorization Reference*\. However, that topic doesn't list all of the condition keys that you can use to refine each permission\.

**Note**  
You might have to scroll horizontally or vertically to see all of the data in the table\.

## Column descriptions<a name="permissions-column-descriptions"></a>

The columns in this table provide the following information:
+ **Actions and permissions **lists each AWS KMS API operation and the permission that allows the operation\. You specify the operation in `Action` element of a policy statement\.
+ **Policy type** indicates whether the permission can be used in a key policy or IAM policy\. 

  *Key policy* means that you can specify the permission in the key policy\. When the key policy contains the [policy statement that enables IAM policies](key-policy-default.md#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam), you can specify the permission in an IAM policy\. 

  *IAM policy* means that you can specify the permission only in an IAM policy\.
+ **Cross\-account use** shows the operations that authorized users can perform on resources in a different AWS account\. 

  A value of *Yes* means that principals can perform the operation on resources in a different AWS account\.

  A value of *No* means that principals can perform the operation only on resources in their own AWS account\.

  If you give a principal in a different account a permission that can't be used on a cross\-account resource, the permission is not effective\. For example, if you give a principal in a different account [kms:TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) permission to a KMS key in your account, their attempts to tag the KMS key in your account will fail\.
+ **Resources** lists the AWS KMS resources to which the permissions apply\. AWS KMS supports two resource types: a KMS key and an alias\. In a key policy, the value of the `Resource` element is always `*`, which indicates the KMS key to which the key policy is attached\. 

  Use the following values to represent an AWS KMS resource in an IAM policy\.  
**KMS key**  
When the resource is a KMS key, use its [key ARN](concepts.md#key-id-key-ARN)\. For help, see [Finding the key ID and key ARN](find-cmk-id-arn.md)\.  
`arn:AWS_partition_name:kms:AWS_Region:AWS_account_ID:key/key_ID`  
For example:  
arn:aws:kms:us\-west\-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd\-12ab\-34cd\-56ef\-1234567890ab  
**Alias**  
When the resource is an alias, use its [alias ARN](concepts.md#key-id-alias-ARN)\. For help, see [Finding the alias name and alias ARN](find-cmk-alias.md)\.  
`arn:AWS_partition_name:kms:AWS_region:AWS_account_ID:alias/alias_name`  
For example:  
arn:aws:kms:us\-west\-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias  
**`*` \(asterisk\)**  
When the permission doesn't apply to a particular resource \(KMS key or alias\), use an asterisk \(`*`\)\.  
In an IAM policy for an AWS KMS permission, an asterisk in the `Resource` element indicates all AWS KMS resources \(KMS keys and aliases\)\. You can also use an asterisk in the `Resource` element when the AWS KMS permission doesn't apply to any particular KMS keys or aliases\. For example, when allowing or denying `kms:CreateKey` or `kms:ListKeys` permission, you can set the `Resource` element to `*` or to an account\-specific variation, such as `arn:AWS_partition_name:kms:AWS_region:AWS_account_ID:*`\.
+ **AWS KMS condition keys** lists the AWS KMS condition keys that you can use to control access to the operation\. You specify conditions in a policy's `Condition` element\. For more information, see [AWS KMS condition keys](conditions-kms.md)\. This column also includes [AWS global condition keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) that are supported by AWS KMS, but not by all AWS services\.
