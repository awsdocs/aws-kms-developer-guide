# Request quotas<a name="requests-per-second"></a>

AWS KMS establishes quotas for the number of API operations requested in each second\. The request quotas differ with the API operation, the AWS Region, and other factors, such as the KMS key type\. When you exceed an API request quota, AWS KMS [throttles the request](throttling.md)\.

All AWS KMS request quotas are adjustable\. To request a quota increase, use the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas) or the [RequestServiceQuotaIncrease](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/2019-06-24/apireference/API_RequestServiceQuotaIncrease.html) operation\. For instructions, see [Requesting an AWS KMS quota increase](increase-quota.md)\. For details, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\. If Service Quotas for AWS KMS are not available in your AWS Region, please visit the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) and create a case\. 

If you are exceeding the request quota for the [GenerateDataKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKey.html) operation, consider using the [data key caching](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/data-key-caching.html) feature of the AWS Encryption SDK\. Reusing data keys might reduce the frequency of your requests to AWS KMS\. 

In addition to request quotas, AWS KMS uses resource quotas to ensure capacity for all users\. For details, see [Resource quotas](resource-limits.md)\.

To view trends in your request rates, use the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas)\. You can also create an [Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/) alarm that alerts you when your request rate reaches a certain percentage of a quota value\. For details, see [Manage your AWS KMS API request rates using Service Quotas and Amazon CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/manage-your-aws-kms-api-request-rates-using-service-quotas-and-amazon-cloudwatch/) in the *AWS Security Blog*\.

## Applying request quotas<a name="about-rate-limits"></a>

When reviewing request quotas, keep in mind the following information\.
+ Request quotas apply to both [customer managed keys](concepts.md#customer-cmk) and [AWS managed keys](concepts.md#aws-managed-cmk)\. The use of [AWS owned keys](concepts.md#aws-owned-cmk) does not count against request quotas for your AWS account, even when they are used to protect resources in your account\.
+ Request quotas apply to requests sent to FIPS endpoints and non\-FIPS endpoints\. For a list of AWS KMS service endpoints, see [AWS Key Management Service endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html) in the AWS General Reference\.
+ Throttling is based on all requests on KMS keys of all types in the Region\. This total includes requests from all principals in the AWS account, including requests from AWS services on your behalf\.
+ Each request quota is calculated independently\. For example, requests for the [CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html) operation have no effect on the request quota for the [CreateAlias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAlias.html) operation\. If your `CreateAlias` requests are throttled, your `CreateKey` requests can still complete successfully\. 
+ Although cryptographic operations share a quota, the shared quota is calculated independently of quotas for other operations\. For example, calls to the [Encrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html) and [Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html) operations share a request quota, but that quota is independent of the quota for management operations, such as [EnableKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_EnableKey.html)\. For example, in the Europe \(London\) Region, you can perform 10,000 cryptographic operations on symmetric KMS keys *plus* 5 `EnableKey` operations per second without being throttled\.

## Shared quotas for cryptographic operations<a name="rps-shared-limit"></a>

AWS KMS [cryptographic operations](concepts.md#cryptographic-operations) share request quotas\. You can request any combination of the cryptographic operations that are supported by the KMS key, just so the total number of cryptographic operations doesn't exceed the request quota for that type of KMS key\. The exceptions are [GenerateDataKeyPair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKeyPair.html) and [GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext.html), which share a separate quota\. 

The quotas for different types of KMS keys are calculated independently\. Each quota applies to all requests for these operations in the AWS account and Region with the given key type in each one\-second interval\.
+ *Cryptographic operations \(symmetric\) request rate* is the shared request quota for cryptographic operations using symmetric KMS keys in an account and region\. This quota applies to cryptographic operations with symmetric encryption keys and HMAC keys, which are also symmetric\.

  For example, you might be using [symmetric KMS keys](concepts.md#symmetric-cmks) in an AWS Region with a shared quota of 10,000 requests per second\. When you make 7,000 [GenerateDataKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKey.html) requests per second and 2,000 [Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html) requests per second, AWS KMS doesn't throttle your requests\. However, when you make 9,500 `GenerateDataKey` requests and 1,000 [Encrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html) and requests per second, AWS KMS throttles your requests because they exceed the shared quota\.
+ *Cryptographic operations \(RSA\) request rate* is the shared request quota for cryptographic operations using [RSA asymmetric KMS keys](asymmetric-key-specs.md#key-spec-rsa)\. 

  For example, with a request quota of 500 operations per second, you can make 200 [Encrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html) requests and 100 [Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html) requests with RSA KMS keys that can encrypt and decrypt, plus 50 [Sign](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Sign.html) requests and 150 [Verify](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Verify.html) requests with RSA KMS keys that can sign and verify\.
+ *Cryptographic operations \(ECC\) request rate* is the shared request quota for cryptographic operations using [elliptic curve \(ECC\) asymmetric KMS keys](asymmetric-key-specs.md#key-spec-ecc)\. 

  For example, with a request quota of 300 operations per second, you can make 100 Sign requests and 200 Verify requests with RSA KMS keys that can sign and verify\.
+ *Cryptographic operations \(SM â€” China Regions only\) request rate* is the shared request quota for cryptographic operations using [SM asymmetric KMS keys](asymmetric-key-specs.md#key-spec-sm)\. 

  For example, with a request quota of 300 operations per second, you can make 100 [Encrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html) requests and 100 [Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html) requests with SM2 KMS keys that can encrypt and decrypt, plus 50 [Sign](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Sign.html) requests and 50 [Verify](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Verify.html) requests with SM2 KMS keys that can sign and verify\.

The quotas for different key types are also calculated independently\. For example, in the Asia Pacific \(Singapore\) Region, if you use both symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, you can make up to 10,000 calls per second with symmetric KMS keys \(including HMAC keys\) *plus* up to 500 additional calls per second with your RSA asymmetric KMS keys, *plus* up to 300 additional requests per second with your ECC\-based KMS keys\.

## API requests made on your behalf<a name="rps-from-service"></a>

You can make API requests directly or by using an integrated AWS service that makes API requests to AWS KMS on your behalf\. The quota applies to both kinds of requests\.

For example, you might store data in Amazon S3 using server\-side encryption with a KMS key \(SSE\-KMS\)\. Each time you upload or download an S3 object that's encrypted with SSE\-KMS, Amazon S3 makes a `GenerateDataKey` \(for uploads\) or `Decrypt` \(for downloads\) request to AWS KMS on your behalf\. These requests count toward your quota, so AWS KMS throttles the requests if you exceed a combined total of 5,500 \(or 10,000 or 50,000 depending upon your AWS Region\) uploads or downloads per second of S3 objects encrypted with SSE\-KMS\.

## Cross\-account requests<a name="rps-cross-account"></a>

When an application in one AWS account uses a KMS key owned by a different account, it's known as a *cross\-account request*\. For cross\-account requests, AWS KMS throttles the account that makes the requests, not the account that owns the KMS key\. For example, if an application in account A uses a KMS key in account B, the KMS key use applies only to the quotas in account A\.

## Custom key store quota<a name="rps-key-stores"></a>

AWS KMS custom key stores support only [symmetric encryption KMS keys](concepts.md#symmetric-cmks)\. The `Cryptographic operations (symmetric) request rate` for each AWS account and Region applies to KMS keys in a custom key store\. For example, each AWS account can have up to 50,000 requests per second on symmetric KMS keys in US East \(N\. Virginia\) \(us\-east\-1\), including requests that use KMS keys in custom key stores\.

In addition, the KMS keys in each custom key store share a `Cryptographic operations (symmetric) request rate` request quota of 1,800 operations per second\. This *custom key store quota* is calculated separately for each custom key store\. It might include requests from multiple AWS accounts that use KMS keys in the custom key store\.

Requests for [cryptographic operations](concepts.md#cryptographic-operations) on a KMS key in a custom key store apply both to the account\-level quota on the calling account and the custom key store quota\. For example, if you request an [Encrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html) operation on a KMS key in a custom key store in the US East \(N\. Virginia\) \(us\-east\-1\) Region, that request counts toward the account\-level quota \(50,000 requests per second for each account\) and toward the custom key store quota \(1,800 requests per second for each custom key store\)\. However, a request for a management operation, such as [PutKeyPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_PutKeyPolicy.html), on a KMS key in a custom key store applies only to its account\-level quota \(15 requests per second\)\.

**Note**  
If the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store is processing numerous commands, including those unrelated to the custom key store, you might get an AWS KMS `ThrottlingException` at a lower\-than\-expected rate\. If this occurs, lower your request rate to AWS KMS, reduce the unrelated load, or use a dedicated AWS CloudHSM cluster for your custom key store\.  
AWS KMS also throttles cryptographic operations on KMS keys in custom key stores when there are no available PKCS11 sessions for the AWS CloudHSM cluster\. These `ThrottlingException` instances typically occur during periods of high burst traffic when additional sessions are needed to service the traffic\.
