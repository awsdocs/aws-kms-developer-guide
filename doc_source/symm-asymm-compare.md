# Key type reference<a name="symm-asymm-compare"></a>

AWS KMS supports different features for different types of KMS keys\. For example, you can only use [symmetric encryption KMS keys](concepts.md#symmetric-cmks) to [generate symmetric data keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKey.html) and [asymmetric data key pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKeyPairs.html)\. Also, [importing key material](importing-keys.md) and [automatic key rotation](rotate-keys.md) are supported only for symmetric encryption KMS keys, and you can create only symmetric encryption KMS keys in a [custom key store](custom-key-store-overview.md)\. 

This reference includes two tables\. 
+ The [Key type table](#key-type-table) lists the AWS KMS operations that are valid for symmetric encryption KMS keys, asymmetric KMS keys, and HMAC KMS keys\. 
+ The [Special features table](#special-features-table) lists the AWS KMS operations that are valid for multi\-Region KMS keys, KMS keys with imported key material, and KMS keys in custom key stores\.

## Special features table<a name="special-features-table"></a>

This table shows the AWS KMS API operations that are supported on each type of special\-purpose key\. 

While reading this table, be aware of the following interactions:
+ [Multi\-Region keys](multi-region-keys-overview.md): 
  + Multi\-Region keys can be symmetric encryption KMS keys, asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, and KMS keys with imported key material\.
  + You cannot create multi\-Region keys in a custom key store\.
+ [Imported key material](importing-keys.md)
  + Only symmetric encryption KMS keys can have imported key material\.
  + You can create multi\-Region keys with imported key material\.
  + You cannot create keys with imported key material in a custom key store\. 
  + Automatic key rotation \(`EnableKeyRotation`, `DisableKeyRotation`\) is not supported for KMS keys with imported key material\.
+ [Custom key stores](custom-key-store-overview.md)
  + Custom key stores support only symmetric encryption KMS keys\.
  + Symmetric operations on asymmetric key pairs \(`GenerateDataKeyPair`, `GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext`\) are not supported on KMS keys in custom key stores\.
  + Automatic key rotation \(`EnableKeyRotation`, `DisableKeyRotation`\) is not supported on KMS keys in custom key stores\.
  + You cannot create multi\-Region keys in custom key stores\.
