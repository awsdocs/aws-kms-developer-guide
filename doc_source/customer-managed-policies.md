# IAM policy examples<a name="customer-managed-policies"></a>

In this section, you can find example IAM policies that allow permissions for various AWS KMS actions\.

**Important**  
Some of the permissions in the following policies are allowed only when the KMS key's key policy also allows them\. For more information, see [Permissions reference](kms-api-permissions-reference.md)\.

For help writing and formatting a JSON policy document, see the [IAM JSON Policy Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## Allow a user to view KMS keys in the AWS KMS console<a name="iam-policy-example-read-only-console"></a>

The following IAM policy allows users read\-only access to the AWS KMS console\. Users with these permissions can view all KMS keys in their AWS account, but they cannot create or change any KMS keys\. 

To view KMS keys on the **AWS managed keys** and **Customer managed keys** pages, principals require [kms:ListKeys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ListKeys.html), [kms:ListAliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ListAliases.html), and [tag:GetResources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_GetResources.html) permissions, even if the keys do not have tags or aliases\. The remaining permissions, particularly [kms:DescribeKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html), are required to view optional KMS key table columns and data on the KMS key detail pages\. The [iam:ListUsers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListUsers.html) and [iam:ListRoles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListRoles.html) permissions are required to display the key policy in default view without error\. To view data on the **Custom key stores** page and details about KMS keys in custom key stores, principals also need [kms:DescribeCustomKeyStores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCustomKeyStores.html) permission\.

If you limit a user's console access to particular KMS keys, the console displays an error for each KMS key that is not visible\. 

This policy includes of two policy statements\. The `Resource` element in the first policy statement allows the specified permissions on all KMS keys in all Regions of the example AWS account\. Console viewers don't need additional access because the AWS KMS console displays only KMS keys in the principal's account\. This is true even if they have permission to view KMS keys in other AWS accounts\. The remaining AWS KMS and IAM permissions require a `"Resource": "*"` element because they don't apply to any particular KMS key\.

        "iam:ListRoles",
        "iam:ListUsers"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Allow a user to create KMS keys<a name="iam-policy-example-create-key"></a>

The following IAM policy allows a user to create all types of KMS keys\. The value of the `Resource` element is `*` because the `CreateKey` operation does not use any particular AWS KMS resources \(KMS keys or aliases\)\.

To restrict the user to particular types of KMS keys, use the [kms:KeySpec](conditions-kms.md#conditions-kms-key-spec), [kms:KeyUsage](conditions-kms.md#conditions-kms-key-usage), and [kms:KeyOrigin](conditions-kms.md#conditions-kms-key-origin) condition keys\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "kms:CreateKey",
    "Resource": "*"
  }
}
```

Principals who create keys might need some related permissions\.
+ **kms:PutKeyPolicy** — Principals who have `kms:CreateKey` permission can set the initial key policy for the KMS key\. However, the `CreateKey` caller must have [kms:PutKeyPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_PutKeyPolicy.html) permission, which lets them change the KMS key policy, or they must specify the `BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` parameter of `CreateKey`, which is not recommended\. The `CreateKey` caller can get `kms:PutKeyPolicy` permission for the KMS key from an IAM policy or they can include this permission in the key policy of the KMS key that they're creating\.
+ **kms:TagResource** — To add tags to the KMS key during the `CreateKey` operation, the `CreateKey` caller must have [kms:TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) permission in an IAM policy\. Including this permission in the key policy of the new KMS key isn't sufficient\. However, if the `CreateKey` caller includes `kms:TagResource` in the initial key policy, they can add tags in a separate call after the KMS key is created\.
+ **kms:CreateAlias** — Principals who create a KMS key in the AWS KMS console must have [kms:CreateAlias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAlias.html) permission on the KMS key and on the alias\. \(The console makes two calls; one to `CreateKey` and one to `CreateAlias`\)\. You must provide the alias permission in an IAM policy\. You can provide the KMS key permission in a key policy or IAM policy\. For details, see [Controlling access to aliases](alias-access.md)\.

In addition to `kms:CreateKey`, the following IAM policy provides `kms:TagResource` permission on all KMS keys in the AWS account and `kms:CreateAlias` permission on all aliases that the account\. It also includes some useful read\-only permissions that can be provided only in an IAM policy\. 

This IAM policy does not include `kms:PutKeyPolicy` permission or any other permissions that can be set in a key policy\. It's a [best practice](iam-policies-best-practices.md) to set these permissions in the key policy where they apply exclusively to one KMS key\.

## Allow a user to encrypt and decrypt with any KMS key in a specific AWS account<a name="iam-policy-example-encrypt-decrypt-one-account"></a>

The following IAM policy allows a user to encrypt and decrypt data with any KMS key in AWS account 111122223333\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "kms:Encrypt",
      "kms:Decrypt"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:*:111122223333:key/*"
  }
}
```

## Allow a user to encrypt and decrypt with any KMS key in a specific AWS account and Region<a name="iam-policy-example-encrypt-decrypt-one-account-one-region"></a>

The following IAM policy allows a user to encrypt and decrypt data with any KMS key in AWS account `111122223333` in the US West \(Oregon\) Region\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "kms:Encrypt",
      "kms:Decrypt"
    ],
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/*"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Allow a user to encrypt and decrypt with specific KMS keys<a name="iam-policy-example-encrypt-decrypt-specific-cmks"></a>

The following IAM policy allows a user to encrypt and decrypt data with the two KMS keys specified in the `Resource` element\. When specifying a KMS key in an IAM policy statement, you must use the [key ARN](concepts.md#key-id-key-ARN) of the KMS key\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "kms:Encrypt",
      "kms:Decrypt"
    ],
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
      "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Prevent a user from disabling or deleting any KMS keys<a name="iam-policy-example-deny-disable-delete"></a>

The following IAM policy prevents a user from disabling or deleting any KMS keys, even when another IAM policy or a key policy allows these permissions\. A policy that explicitly denies permissions overrides all other policies, even those that explicitly allow the same permissions\. For more information, see [Troubleshooting key access](policy-evaluation.md)\.

  "Version": "2012-10-17",

      "kms:DisableKey",
      "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
  }
}
