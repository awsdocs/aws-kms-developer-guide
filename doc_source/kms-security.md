# Security of AWS Key Management Service<a name="kms-security"></a>

Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority\. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that are built to meet the requirements of the most security\-sensitive organizations\.

Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you\. The [shared responsibility model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) describes this as security of the cloud and security in the cloud:
+ **Security *of* the cloud** – AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud\. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely\. Third\-party auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the [AWS Compliance Programs](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/)\. To learn about the compliance programs that apply to AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\), see [AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/)\.
+ **Security *in* the cloud** – Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use\. In AWS KMS, in addition to your configuration and use of customer master keys, you are responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your company’s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations 

This documentation helps you understand how to apply the shared responsibility model when using AWS Key Management Service\. It shows you how to configure AWS KMS to meet your security and compliance objectives\.
