# AWS CloudHSM key stores<a name="keystore-cloudhsm"></a>

an AWS CloudHSM custom key store is a custom key store backed by a [AWS CloudHSM cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/)\. When you create an [AWS KMS key](concepts.md#kms_keys) in a custom key store, AWS KMS generates and stores non\-extractable key material for the KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM cluster that you own and manage\. When you use a KMS key in a custom key store, the [cryptographic operations](use-cmk-keystore.md) are performed in the HSMs in the cluster\. This feature combines the convenience and widespread integration of AWS KMS with the added control of an AWS CloudHSM cluster in your AWS account\. 

AWS KMS supports [custom key stores](custom-key-store-overview.md) backed by [AWS CloudHSM clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/)\. When you create an [AWS KMS key](concepts.md#kms_keys) in a custom key store, AWS KMS generates and stores non\-extractable key material for the KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM cluster that you own and manage\. When you use a KMS key in a custom key store, the [cryptographic operations](use-cmk-keystore.md) are performed in the HSMs in the cluster\. This feature combines the convenience and widespread integration of AWS KMS with the added control of an AWS CloudHSM cluster in your AWS account\. 

AWS KMS provides full console and API support for creating, using, and managing your custom key stores\. You can use the KMS keys in your custom key store the same way that you use any KMS key\. For example, you can use the KMS keys to generate data keys and encrypt data\. You can also use the KMS keys in your custom key store with AWS services that support customer managed keys\.

**Do I need a custom key store?**

For most users, the default AWS KMS key store, which is protected by [FIPS 140\-2 validated cryptographic modules](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/Certificate/3139), fulfills their security requirements\. There is no need to add an extra layer of maintenance responsibility or a dependency on an additional service\. 

However, you might consider creating a custom key store if your organization has any of the following requirements:
+ Key material cannot be stored in a shared environment\.
+ Key material must be subject to a secondary, independent audit path\.
+ The HSMs that generate and store key material must be certified at [FIPS 140\-2 Level 3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/compliance.html)\.

**How do custom key stores work?**

Each custom key store is associated with an AWS CloudHSM cluster in your AWS account\. When you connect the custom key store to its cluster, AWS KMS creates the network infrastructure to support the connection\. Then it logs into the key AWS CloudHSM client in the cluster using the credentials of a [dedicated crypto user](hsm-key-store-concepts.md#concept-kmsuser) in the cluster\.

You create and manage your custom key stores in AWS KMS and create and manage your HSM clusters in AWS CloudHSM\. When you create AWS KMS keys in an AWS KMS custom key store, you view and manage the KMS keys in AWS KMS\. But you can also view and manage their key material in AWS CloudHSM, just as you would do for other keys in the cluster\.

![\[Managing KMS keys in a custom key store\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/images/kms-hsm-view.png)

You can [create symmetric encryption KMS keys](create-cmk-keystore.md) with key material generated by AWS KMS in your custom key store\. Then use the same techniques to view and manage the KMS keys in your custom key store that you use for KMS keys in the AWS KMS key store\. You can control access with IAM and key policies, create tags and aliases, enable and disable the KMS keys, and schedule key deletion\. You can use the KMS keys for [cryptographic operations](use-cmk-keystore.md) and use them with AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS\. 

In addition, you have full control over the AWS CloudHSM cluster, including creating and deleting HSMs and managing backups\. You can use the AWS CloudHSM client and supported software libraries to view, audit, and manage the key material for your KMS keys\. While the custom key store is disconnected, AWS KMS cannot access it, and users cannot use the KMS keys in the custom key store for cryptographic operations\. This added layer of control makes custom key stores a powerful solution for organizations that require it\.

**Where do I start?**

To create and manage an AWS CloudHSM key store, you use features of AWS KMS and AWS CloudHSM\.

1. Start in AWS CloudHSM\. [Create an active AWS CloudHSM cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) or select an existing cluster\. The cluster must have at least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones\. Then create a [dedicated crypto user \(CU\) account](hsm-key-store-concepts.md#concept-kmsuser) in that cluster for AWS KMS\. 

1. In AWS KMS, [create a custom key store](create-keystore.md) that is associated with your selected AWS CloudHSM cluster\. AWS KMS provides [a complete management interface](manage-keystore.md) that lets you create, view, edit, and delete your custom key stores\.

1. When you're ready to use your custom key store, [connect it to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster](disconnect-keystore.md)\. AWS KMS creates the network infrastructure that it needs to support the connection\. It then logs in to the cluster using the dedicated crypto user account credentials so it can generate and manage key material in the cluster\.

1. Now, you can [create symmetric encryption KMS keys in your custom key store](create-cmk-keystore.md)\. Just specify the custom key store when you create the KMS key\.

If you get stuck at any point, you can find help in the [Troubleshooting a custom key store](fix-keystore.md) topic\. If your question is not answered, use the feedback link at the bottom of each page of this guide or post a question on the [AWS Key Management Service Discussion Forum](https://repost.aws/tags/TAMC3vcPOPTF-rPAHZVRj1PQ/aws-key-management-service)\.

**Quotas**

AWS KMS allows up to [10 custom key stores](resource-limits.md) in each AWS account and Region, including both [AWS CloudHSM key stores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-cloudhsm.html) and [external key stores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html), regardless of their connection state\. In addition, there are AWS KMS request quotas on the [use of KMS keys in a custom key store](requests-per-second.md#rps-key-stores)\.

**Pricing**

For information on the cost of AWS KMS custom key stores and customer managed keys in a custom key store, see [AWS Key Management Service pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/)\. For information about the cost of AWS CloudHSM clusters and HSMs, see [AWS CloudHSM Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/pricing/)\.<a name="cks-regions"></a>

**Regions**

AWS KMS supports custom key stores in all AWS Regions where AWS KMS is supported, except for Asia Pacific \(Hyderabad\), China \(Beijing\), China \(Ningxia\), Europe \(Spain\), Europe \(Zurich\), and Middle East \(UAE\)\.
