# Key states of AWS KMS keys<a name="key-state"></a>

An AWS KMS key always has a key state\. Operations on the KMS key and its environment can change that key state, either transiently, or until another operation changes its key state\.

The table in this section shows how key states affect calls to AWS KMS API operations\. As a result of its key state, an operation on a KMS key is expected to succeed \(`âœ“`\), fail \(`X`\), or succeed only under certain conditions \(`?`\)\. The result often differs for KMS keys with imported key material\.

This table includes only the API operations that use an existing KMS key\. Other operations, such as [CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html) and [ListKeys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ListKeys.html), are omitted\.

## Key states and KMS key types<a name="key-state-cmk-type"></a>

The type of the KMS key determines the key states it can have\.
+ All KMS keys can be in the `Enabled`, `Disabled`, and `PendingDeletion` states\.
+ Most KMS keys are created in the `Enabled` state\. Keys with imported key material are created in the `PendingImport` state\.
+ The `PendingImport` state applies only to KMS keys with [imported key material](importing-keys.md)\.
+ The `Unavailable` state applies only to a KMS key in a [custom key store](custom-key-store-overview.md)\. A KMS key in an [AWS CloudHSM key store](keystore-cloudhsm.md) is `Unavailable` when the custom key store is intentionally disconnected from its AWS CloudHSM cluster\. A KMS key in an [external key store](keystore-external.md) is `Unavailable` when the custom key store is intentionally disconnected from its [external key store proxy](keystore-external.md#concept-xks-proxy)\. You can view and manage unavailable KMS keys, but you cannot use them in cryptographic operations\.

  The key state of a KMS key in a custom key store is not affected by changes to its backing key\. A KMS key in a AWS CloudHSM key store is not affected by changes to its [associated key material](hsm-key-store-concepts.md#concept-cmk-key-store) in the AWS CloudHSM cluster\. A KMS key in an external key store is not affected by changes to its [external key](keystore-external.md#concept-external-key) in an external key manager\. If the backing key is disabled or deleted, the KMS key state doesn't change, but cryptographic operations using the KMS key fail\.
+ The `Creating`, `Updating`, and `PendingReplicaDeletion` key states apply only to [multi\-Region keys](multi-region-keys-overview.md)\. 
  + A multi\-Region replica key is in the transient `Creating` key state while it is being created\. This process might still be in progress when the [ReplicateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ReplicateKey.html) operation completes\. When the replicate process completes, the replica key is in the `Enabled` or `PendingImport` state\.
  + Multi\-Region keys are in the transient `Updating` key state while the primary Region is being updated\. This process might still be in progress when the [UpdatePrimaryRegion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePrimaryRegion.html) operation completes\. When the update process completes, the primary and replica keys resume the `Enabled` key state\.
  + When you schedule deletion of a multi\-Region primary key that has replica keys, the primary key is in the `PendingReplicaDeletion` state until all of its replica keys are deleted\. Then its key state changes to `PendingDeletion`\. For details, see [Deleting multi\-Region keys](multi-region-keys-delete.md)\.

**Table Details**
+ \[1\] `DisabledException: <key ARN> is disabled.`
+ \[2\] `DisabledException: <key ARN> is pending deletion (or pending replica deletion).`
+ \[3\] `KMSInvalidStateException: <key ARN> is pending deletion (or pending replica deletion).`
+ \[4\] `KMSInvalidStateException: <key ARN> is not pending deletion (or pending replica deletion).`
+ \[5\] `KMSInvalidStateException: <key ARN> is pending import.`
+ \[6\] `UnsupportedOperationException: <key ARN> origin is EXTERNAL which is not valid for this operation.`
+ \[7\] If the KMS key has imported key material or is in a custom key store: `UnsupportedOperationException`\.
+ \[8\] If the KMS key has imported key material: `KMSInvalidStateException`
+ \[9\] If the KMS key cannot or does not have imported key material: `UnsupportedOperationException`\.
+ \[10\] If the source KMS key is pending deletion, the command succeeds\. If the destination KMS key is pending deletion, the command fails with error: `KMSInvalidStateException : <key ARN> is pending deletion.`
+ \[11\] `KMSInvalidStateException: <key ARN> is unavailable.` You cannot perform this operation on an unavailable KMS key\.
+ \[12\] The operation succeeds, but the key state of the KMS key does not change until it becomes available\.
+ \[13\] While a KMS key in a custom key store is pending deletion, its key state remains `PendingDeletion` even if the KMS key becomes unavailable\. This allows you to cancel deletion of the KMS key at any time during the waiting period\.
+ \[14\] `KMSInvalidStateException: <key ARN> is creating.` AWS KMS throws this exception while it is replicating a multi\-Region key \(`ReplicateKey`\)\.
+ \[15\] `KMSInvalidStateException: <key ARN> is updating.` AWS KMS throws this exception while it is updating the primary Region of a multi\-Region key \(`UpdatePrimaryRegion`\)\.
